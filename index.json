This approach involves frequent code integration, automated testing, and continuous deployment of software changes to production. Before the adoption of CI/CD in the software development industry, the common approach was a traditional, waterfall model of software development. In this approach, developers worked in silos, with each stage of the software development life cycle completed in sequence. The process typically involved gathering requirements, designing the software, coding, testing, and deployment.\nThe disadvantages of this traditional approach include:\nSlow Release Cycles High Failure Rates Limited Collaboration High Cost Limited Agility CI/CD emerged as a solution to these disadvantages, by introducing a more agile and collaborative approach to software development. CI/CD enables teams to work together, integrating their code changes frequently, and automating the testing and deployment process.\nContinuous Integration (CI) CI is the process of merging all the Developer code changes to a single shared main branch as often as possible, frequently. Developers merge their code changes, many times a day to the remote Git Repositoryâ€™s main branch. These code changes are then verified and validated by using automation to create builds and run tests on the created builds. So, the new code changes being pushed are built, integrated and tested in a few minutes, providing immediate feedback to the developer about the code status and any issues. Continuous Integration ensures that the application is not broken whenever new commits from all the developers are integrated into the Release branch of the Repository, as they are all tested well in advance.\nContinuous Delivery (CD) Continuous Delivery is the practice where the code changes are released frequently in shorter cycles to customers, quickly and reliably. In continuation with Automated Testing in CI, the application Release process is completely automated so that the code changes can be deployed incrementally at any point of time by just clicking a button (manual trigger). Generally, shorter release cycles are recommended. Depending on the size of the project, and business requirements, you can configure daily, weekly, fortnightly release schedules. The shorter the release cycle the easier it is to troubleshoot in case of any issue after deployment onto a Production environment.\nContinuous Deployment (CD) Continuous Delivery without a manual trigger is Continuous Deployment. In Continuous Deployment, every code change is directly released to customers without any manual intervention if it successfully passes all the stages of your CI/CD pipeline. So, if there are no failures in any pipeline tests, every code change is available to the customers immediately. This level of automation is made possible by a combination of several different tools and processes that work together to verify and push the code changes to production. Once the developer pushes the new code change, it is automatically built, integrated, tested, and directly deployed to the production environment. The key benefits of CI/CD include:\nFaster Release Cycles Improved Quality Increased Collaboration Reduced Risk Cost-Effective In summary, CI/CD emerged as a solution to the limitations of the traditional, linear approach to software development. By introducing a more agile and collaborative approach to software development, CI/CD enables teams to work together, release software more frequently, and respond quickly to customer needs.\nWowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, youâ€™ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy â€¦","date":1696464000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696464000,"objectID":"07e02bccc368a192a0c76c44918396c3","permalink":"https://example.com/post/writing-technical-content/","publishdate":"2023-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/writing-technical-content/","section":"post","summary":"Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a software development approach that aims to improve the speed, efficiency, and reliability of software delivery.

Have you already felt all this autumn mood when you want to drink cocoa and watch different movies or read books? I love autumn for that. But since I am actively studying now, it is studying that takes most of the time. This week, for example, I did several laboratory works on Scientific Programming at once. I also watched several videos about neural networks (here and here), because my future dissertation work assumes the use of a neural network to determine the optimal strategy for the redistribution of resources in a 5G network.\nBut I have one piece of good news, because last weekend I finally picked up a book from the post office that my friend brought me straight from my beloved Paris. This is a mystical novel by a belgian singer - Loic Nottet, whom I have been listening to since his performance at Eurovision and I am very happy now that I have his book.\nBy the way, if you donâ€™t know what to read these autumn evenings, then keep a selection of my favorite books:\nVictor Hugo Â«Notre-Dame de ParisÂ» Erich Maria Remarque Â«Arch of TriumphÂ» and Â«Three ComradesÂ» Ray Bradbury Â«Fahrenheit 451Â» Veniamin Kaverin Â«The Two CaptainsÂ» Guillaume Musso Â«An Apartment in ParisÂ» Have a nice week everyone, bye!\n","date":1696464000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696464000,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://example.com/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2023-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Hello everybody!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my first post about last week!","tags":["Autumn"],"title":"First Week...","type":"post"},{"authors":["Kseniia Leonteva"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
