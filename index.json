Cut the butter into small cubes and add to the bowl. Use clean dry hands to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles sand and the butter is no larger than the size of a pea. Spoon in the ice water and use a butter knife to combine the ingredients together. Pour the pie dough out onto the work top and form into a ball. Cover and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Roll the chilled pie dough out to 1/8\u0026#34; or 1/2 cm thick and place in a 8\u0026#34; or 20cm pie dish.

Place into a 230C / 450F oven on the bottom rack and immediately turn the the temperature down to 170C / 325F. Bake for about 50 minutes to one hour or until the center of the pie only slightly jiggles when shaken. Cool the pie completely at room temperature. Serve with a dollop of freshly whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.\nNOTES If you are using homemade pumpkin puree, cut a pumpkin in half and bake face down for around 40 minutes at 200C or 400F until soft. Leave to cool before scooping out the flesh and blending. Squeeze out as much moisture as you can by wrapping the pureed pumpkin in a tea towel and squeezing.

CI/CD enables teams to work together, integrating their code changes frequently, and automating the testing and deployment process.\nContinuous Integration (CI) CI is the process of merging all the Developer code changes to a single shared main branch as often as possible, frequently. Developers merge their code changes, many times a day to the remote Git Repository’s main branch. These code changes are then verified and validated by using automation to create builds and run tests on the created builds. So, the new code changes being pushed are built, integrated and tested in a few minutes, providing immediate feedback to the developer about the code status and any issues. Continuous Integration ensures that the application is not broken whenever new commits from all the developers are integrated into the Release branch of the Repository, as they are all tested well in advance.\nContinuous Delivery (CD) Continuous Delivery is the practice where the code changes are released frequently in shorter cycles to customers, quickly and reliably. In continuation with Automated Testing in CI, the application Release process is completely automated so that the code changes can be deployed incrementally at any point of time by just clicking a button (manual trigger).
