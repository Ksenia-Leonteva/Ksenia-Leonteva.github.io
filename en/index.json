I recently passed an essay on Information Security and in this post I would also like to talk about one of the algorithms used, namely Fermat‚Äôs method for factorization.\nIn 1643, Pierre de Fermat proposed a factorization method. He noticed that a composite number can always be represented as the difference of two squares and, based on this observation, proposed a simple method for finding divisors.\nLet $n = a \\cdot b$, where $a$ and $b$ are natural, not necessarily prime, divisors of the number $n$ and $a\u0026gt;b$. Then $n=x^2-y^2$, where $x=\\frac{a+b}{2}$, $y=\\frac{a-b}{2}$.\nFermat‚Äôs method of factorization consists of going through all possible values of $x$ and checking whether the number $n-x^2$ is a perfect square. If this condition is met, then the divisors a and b satisfy the equalities $a=(x+y)$ and $b=(x-y)$.\nThe method boils down to trying to find two integers a and b that are close to each other $(a \\approx b)$. The search starts with the smallest integer greater than $x=\\sqrt{n}$. Next, we try to find another integer $y$, such that the equation $y^2=x^2-n$ is satisfied. At each iteration, you need to consider whether the result $x^2-n$ is a perfect square. If such a value is found for y, then $a$ and $b$ are calculated and the loop is exited. Otherwise, another iteration is carried out.\nAlgorithm.\nInput: Odd composite integer $n\u0026gt;0$.\nOutput: Natural divisor $a\u0026gt;1$ of $n$.\nCalculate the smallest integer $h$ such that $h \\geq \\sqrt{n}$, that is, $h=\\lceil \\sqrt{n} \\rceil$. If $h^2=n$, then determine $a=h$ and complete the algorithm. Define $x \\gets h, v=x^2-n$ and counter $k=0$. If the value $v$ is a perfect square, then determine $y=\\sqrt{v}, a=x+y$ and finish the algorithm. Calculate $k \\gets k+1, x \\gets x+1$ and $v \\gets x^2-n$. Return to point 4. Note: the number of checks of the number $v$ (the number of repetitions at the fourth step of the algorithm) does not exceed the value $y=\\frac{a-b}{2}$.\nIt is worth noting that this method does not necessarily find the prime factorization (canonical factorization), in which case the algorithm must be repeated recursively for each of the values $a$ and $b$ until the prime factors are found.\nFermat‚Äôs method can be applied to the public key cryptographic algorithm RSA, which relies on the computational complexity of the problem of factoring large semiprimes.\nI hope you found this information useful. Have a great week!\n","date":1700006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700006400,"objectID":"19c584e1e617da28db1c64eaad40f05f","permalink":"https://ksenia-leonteva.github.io/en/post/4-week/","publishdate":"2023-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/4-week/","section":"post","summary":"Hello everybody!üëã Welcome to my fourth post about last week!","tags":["Cryptography"],"title":"Fourth Week...","type":"post"},{"authors":["Kseniia Leonteva"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Scientific programming - a programming style focused on scientific calculations.\nScientific programming languages. Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989. Python is classified as a high-level programming language that automatically handles most of the fundamental operations (such as memory management) performed at the processor level (‚Äúmachine code‚Äù). Python is considered a higher-level language than, for example, C because of its expressive syntax (which in many cases is close to natural language) and rich variety of built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Advantages:\nclear and simple syntax allows you to quickly write programs in Python and generally minimizes the possibility of making hidden errors,\nPython operating environment itself and its associated libraries are free and open source, unlike commercial offerings such as Mathematica and MATLAB,\nPython has a large library of modules and packages that extend its functionality,\nmulti-platform support: Python is available for every public computer system, including Windows, Unix, Linux and macOS,\nPython is a flexible language: it is often described as a ‚Äúmulti-paradigm‚Äù language that provides the best functionality for procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\nDisadvantages:\nPython program execution speed is not as fast as programs in other fully compiled languages, such as C and Fortran,\nit is difficult to hide or disguise the source code of a Python program to protect it from being copied and/or modified,\nthroughout Python‚Äôs history, the most common complaints were that its development was too fast, leading to problems of incompatibility between versions.\nFortran programming language was developed in the mid-1950s and became the first high-level type. Today you can often hear that his time passed with the advent of mass-produced computers and remained in the era of punched cards and computers the size of an entire room. However, this language is still relevant. A program in the Fortran programming language is a system composed of library elements, including the main program text, modules, external subroutines and procedures. Any program includes a basic set of combinations of computer instructions and data. In addition, it may or may not contain additional software modules. Advantages:\na very simple and accessible version of the language for learning programming,\ndue to its prevalence throughout the world, Fortran has a large library and a large range of application applications that have been created over its long history,\nthe system has an extensive set of tools available free of charge,\nFortran programming language has a set of tools (translators) for conversion to machine systems of different computers.\nDisadvantages:\nstrict requirements for code format,\na small set of commands to control the program structure,\nweak set of tools for describing data.\nMatlab is a popular tool used for working with matrix databases, virtualization, and mathematical calculations. It is not used for developing software such as games or business solutions. Matlab language is high-level and interpreted. It includes an application package as well as an integrated development environment. It is found primarily in mathematical and engineering problems. It is studied by mathematicians and physicists. The corresponding complex is a set of professional tools for technical calculations, as well as computer modeling. Differs in strict quality requirements. Matlab as a programming language was created in the 1970s by one Cleve Mowler, dean of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico. In its very first version, Matlab was not a full-fledged language. It was a simple interactive matrix calculator. Advantages:\nthis language is much simpler than the SI family and Fortan. It has an intuitive syntax, a good reference and documentation base from the developers,\nusing this language it is possible to work with an advanced library for processing and generating graphs, integrated functions of linear algebra, fast Fourier transform, polynomials, basic statistics, solving differential equations,\nwhat is written in Matlab can be easily translated into C and C++ via Matlab Coder,\nthe package includes application applications from third-party and official developers. They extend the standard functionality of the language.\nDisadvantages:\nMatlab has many operators and commands. They make programs written in the language in question slower,\nuse of the tool is only supported in closed ecosystems. It is not effective on other software platforms,\nthe software environment is a commercial product. It is distributed only for a fee. To purchase the distribution kit at a minimum cost, you must be a university student.\nAlso considered scientific programming languages are: C/C++, ALGOL, APL, J, Julia, Maple and R.\n","date":1700006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700006400,"objectID":"d8930a26ecfadee5768663135505bb04","permalink":"https://ksenia-leonteva.github.io/en/post/science-languages/","publishdate":"2023-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/science-languages/","section":"post","summary":"Scientific programming - a programming style focused on scientific calculations.\nScientific programming languages.

Cut the butter into small cubes and add to the bowl. Use clean dry hands to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles sand and the butter is no larger than the size of a pea. Spoon in the ice water and use a butter knife to combine the ingredients together. Pour the pie dough out onto the work top and form into a ball. Cover and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Roll the chilled pie dough out to 1/8\u0026#34; or 1/2 cm thick and place in a 8\u0026#34; or 20cm pie dish. Cut off the excess pastry and using your thumbs and finger pinch the edges of the dough. Place into the fridge until ready to use.\nPumpkin Pie Filling\nIn a clean bowl add the sugar, salt, spices and eggs. Whisk to combine until there are no longer any lumps.Add the pumpkin puree and evaporated milk and whisk until you are left with a smooth and creamy custard Remove the pie crust from the fridge and pour in the pumpkin pie filling. Place into a 230C / 450F oven on the bottom rack and immediately turn the the temperature down to 170C / 325F. Bake for about 50 minutes to one hour or until the center of the pie only slightly jiggles when shaken. Cool the pie completely at room temperature. Serve with a dollop of freshly whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.\nNOTES If you are using homemade pumpkin puree, cut a pumpkin in half and bake face down for around 40 minutes at 200C or 400F until soft. Leave to cool before scooping out the flesh and blending. Squeeze out as much moisture as you can by wrapping the pureed pumpkin in a tea towel and squeezing. White sugar can be replaced with brown sugar for a more caramel flavour to the pumpkin pie. Evaporated milk can be replaced with cream or half and half.\n","date":1698883200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698883200,"objectID":"3a30b304ac858111e4de2c196ac16cd0","permalink":"https://ksenia-leonteva.github.io/en/post/cake/","publishdate":"2023-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/cake/","section":"post","summary":"Hello everybody!üëã Welcome to my third post about last week!","tags":["Autumn","Halloween"],"title":"Third WeeküéÉ...","type":"post"},{"authors":["Kseniia Leonteva"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

This was addressed in 2014 when long-standing Markdown contributors released CommonMark, an unambiguous specification and test suite for Markdown.\nMarkdown syntax. To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).\nTo create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.\nTo create a line break or new line (\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.\nTo bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.\nTo italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.\nTo emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.\nTo create a blockquote, add a \u0026gt; in front of a paragraph.\nTo create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods.

This approach involves frequent code integration, automated testing, and continuous deployment of software changes to production. Before the adoption of CI/CD in the software development industry, the common approach was a traditional, waterfall model of software development. In this approach, developers worked in silos, with each stage of the software development life cycle completed in sequence. The process typically involved gathering requirements, designing the software, coding, testing, and deployment.\nThe disadvantages of this traditional approach include:\nSlow Release Cycles High Failure Rates Limited Collaboration High Cost Limited Agility CI/CD emerged as a solution to these disadvantages, by introducing a more agile and collaborative approach to software development. CI/CD enables teams to work together, integrating their code changes frequently, and automating the testing and deployment process.\nContinuous Integration (CI) CI is the process of merging all the Developer code changes to a single shared main branch as often as possible, frequently. Developers merge their code changes, many times a day to the remote Git Repository‚Äôs main branch. These code changes are then verified and validated by using automation to create builds and run tests on the created builds. So, the new code changes being pushed are built, integrated and tested in a few minutes, providing immediate feedback to the developer about the code status and any issues. Continuous Integration ensures that the application is not broken whenever new commits from all the developers are integrated into the Release branch of the Repository, as they are all tested well in advance.\nContinuous Delivery (CD) Continuous Delivery is the practice where the code changes are released frequently in shorter cycles to customers, quickly and reliably. In continuation with Automated Testing in CI, the application Release process is completely automated so that the code changes can be deployed incrementally at any point of time by just clicking a button (manual trigger). Generally, shorter release cycles are recommended. Depending on the size of the project, and business requirements, you can configure daily, weekly, fortnightly release schedules. The shorter the release cycle the easier it is to troubleshoot in case of any issue after deployment onto a Production environment.\nContinuous Deployment (CD) Continuous Delivery without a manual trigger is Continuous Deployment. In Continuous Deployment, every code change is directly released to customers without any manual intervention if it successfully passes all the stages of your CI/CD pipeline. So, if there are no failures in any pipeline tests, every code change is available to the customers immediately. This level of automation is made possible by a combination of several different tools and processes that work together to verify and push the code changes to production. Once the developer pushes the new code change, it is automatically built, integrated, tested, and directly deployed to the production environment.\nThe key benefits of CI/CD include:\nFaster Release Cycles Improved Quality Increased Collaboration Reduced Risk Cost-Effective In summary, CI/CD emerged as a solution to the limitations of the traditional, linear approach to software development. By introducing a more agile and collaborative approach to software development, CI/CD enables teams to work together, release software more frequently, and respond quickly to customer needs.\nYou can read more about this here and here.\n","date":1696464000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696464000,"objectID":"07e02bccc368a192a0c76c44918396c3","permalink":"https://ksenia-leonteva.github.io/en/post/writing-technical-content/","publishdate":"2023-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/writing-technical-content/","section":"post","summary":"Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a software development approach that aims to improve the speed, efficiency, and reliability of software delivery.
